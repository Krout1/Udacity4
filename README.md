# Stack Overflow Data - 2018 Survey

## Motivation
BaIT develops more an more different programming languages for a lot of different use cases. Using my data analytics skills, I want to know more about that topic. There for, I will use the data of Stack Overflow's developer survey data from 2017, to answer some questions.

## Labrary use:

pandas - data wrangling
numpy - data wrangling
matplotlib - data visualization
sklearn - data analytics

## Files 

```
├── data	
  ├── survey_results_public.csv.gz		-- survey result data file
  └── survey_results_schema.csv			-- survey schema file	
├── README.md						-- this readme file
└── Survey_Analytics.ipynb				-- jupter nootbook file for data wrangling and data visualization

```

## Summary
Q1. what language is in fashion and what will be the new sexy?

*Python* again climbed in the popularity ranks on our survey. And this year we found that Python was also the most wanted language, meaning that out of data scientists who are not working with this technology, the highest percentage want to start this coming year.

*Julia* is gaining popularity, and although it did not make the 2018 popularity ranks, according to its performance on the wanted list, it could in 2019.

Q2. what framework is in fashion and what will be the new sexy?

The framework most loved by data scientists is *TensorFlow* which has received popularity over years.
*PyTorch* is getting its popularity rapidly.

Q3. which framework makes data scientists more money (who makes more money)?

Data scientists with more coding experience, using PyTorch are making more money.

# Acknowledgment
I would like to express my special thanks to all Stack Overflow contributors and lurking developers of the world who took part in the survey.
Secondly I would also like to thank StackOverflow to share the survey data set.
